# üéõÔ∏è Edge Runner - Web's Resonance Interpreter

<br />

## Usage

Created for ensemble performance with Full Score.

Edge analyzes every performance in real-time. Requests never reach the origin. Each movement resolves entirely between browser and edge, where data resonates naturally without delay or dependency.

**Important:** BEAT is the core component of Full Score. It stands for Behavioral Event Analytics Transform - a linear string format that humans and AI can intuitively understand. Offering BEAT as a service to others or modifications to this format specification must comply with AGPL-3.0 terms.

**Compatibility:** BEAT is considered compatible even if the symbols (! # $ % & ' ( ) * + - . / 0-9 : < = > ? @ A-Z [ ] ^ _ ` a-z { | } ~) [RFC 6265 cookie-octet](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265) or the parser implementation differ, as long as behavioral data is serialized into sequential format preserving temporal order, spatial context, and action semantics, producing an essentially identical semantic stream regardless of storage medium or platform. Any such compatible implementation constitutes a derivative work under copyright law and must comply with AGPL-3.0 terms.
